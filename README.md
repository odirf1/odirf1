## About Me

Hi there 👋 - my name is odirf (my real name is "Frido") and I come from germany.
I like to make Websites in my free time :D
I'm also interested in developing apps. An app will be available soon.

I'm still quite young, but I've already dealt with HTML and CSS.
Now I plan to get into the *real* programming and develop apps.
